#Mixed Messages

##The goal of the project is to generate a randomised message each time for the user 

My interpretation of the excersise is to make a program that prints out "Good morning {name}. it was nice meeting you. Have a nice day."
but each part of the full phrase will be randomly selected from an array of different languages , so that the final message will be a mix of languages .
